# Why You Need to Whitelist Our IPs

To make sure our platform connects seamlessly with your tracking system, it's important to **whitelist our IP addresses**.

### What does "whitelisting an IP" mean?

Whitelisting simply means telling your platform (HasOffers, Everflow, Trackier, Affise, Saarm, etc.) that traffic or requests coming from certain IPs are *trusted*. This prevents calls from being blocked or flagged as suspicious.

### Why do we ask you to whitelist our IPs?

Our system uses these IP addresses to:

* Run **Conversion Imports** into your tracking platform
* Send **Postback Calls** to your server

Since these IPs are **static (they never change)**, once you add them to your whitelist, everything will continue running smoothly.

### Our IPs are:

* 159.69.101.219
* 78.47.166.165
* 88.99.120.240

### Benefits of Whitelisting

By whitelisting the above IPs, you ensure reliable communication and avoid interruptions in reporting, tracking, or postback delivery.
