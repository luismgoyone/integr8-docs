## Introduction

[  ![platform migration tool](https://24metrics.getoutline.com/api/attachments.redirect?id=b5207188-d83a-4ef3-b999-fe3c68062dd8)](https://integr8.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/API-Migration-Tool-1.png)

Migrating to a new tracking platform shouldn't be a nightmare. At Integr8, we've built the Platform Migration Assistant to simplify the transition process for new clients switching from legacy platforms like HasOffers, Everflow, Affise, Trackier, and others. Our goal is to remove the operational friction of reconfiguring your ecosystem from scratch.

## What Is the Platform Migration Assistant?

The Platform Migration Assistant is a purpose-built API service and toolset offered by Integr8 that allows seamless import of your existing:

* Advertisers
* Offers
* Publishers/Affiliates
* Custom parameters and settings

This allows you to replicate your current setup inside Integr8 without manually rebuilding every component, saving days (or weeks) of operational time.

## Supported Source Platforms

Out of the box, the Platform Migration Assistant supports automated migration from:

* HasOffers
* Everflow
* Affise
* Trackier
* Cake

We maintain and update native migrators for these platforms to ensure a high-fidelity migration, preserving all critical metadata and structure.

## Custom Migration Capabilities

Got a custom use case? No problem. Our tech team offers flexible migration support through:

* Custom migrator development for unsupported or proprietary systems
* Modifications to existing migrators, such as:
* Importing only active offers and publishers
* Skipping paused/expired entities
* Mapping legacy fields to Integr8's schema
* You tell us the scope, we'll build the pipeline.

We understand how sensitive migrations are. The Platform Migration Assistant is designed for:

* Non-destructive syncs, no data loss, no overwrite unless specified
* Test imports, simulate migration to verify mappings
* Incremental migration, handle large datasets in chunks

## Why It Matters

Rebuilding your advertiser and offer infrastructure manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and expensive. The Platform Migration Assistant compresses what could be a multi-week process into hours, with full flexibility and technical support behind it.

## Getting Started

Once you've signed up with Integr8, contact your support manager and provide the following information:

* Specify your current platform and access credentials (API keys, etc.)
* Choose your import scope: full import or partial (e.g., only active offers)
* Schedule migration
* Validate imported data through the Integr8 dashboard
* For complex or high-volume accounts, our onboarding team will manage the process end-to-end.

## Need Custom Help?

Just ask. Our dev team can support any unique requirement, whether you're migrating from an in-house tool or need custom field handling.

## Conclusion

The Platform Migration Assistant is your shortcut to onboard with Integr8 Tracking Platform without the usual setup pain. Whether you're coming from HasOffers, Everflow, Affise, or any other platform, we make the move clean, fast, and reliable.
