# Introduction

This is the full external API documentation for the [Integr8](https://www.semrush.com/swa/checker/Integr8.co) API. The API is organised around REST principles like resource-oriented URLs and uses standard HTTP features like response codes, verbs and Authentication. At Integr8, we build features API-first and have built our web application on top of the API as we want to make our core functionality available to developers to consume programmatically.

You can refer to the API reference for a full list of supported endpoints. If it is the first time you are using the API, go to the *[API Documentation](https://integr8.co/docs/articles/api-documentation/)* section for an Overview of the API methods.
