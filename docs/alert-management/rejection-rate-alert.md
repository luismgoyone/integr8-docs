## High Rejection Rate Alert Setup

Rejection Rate Alerts notify you when the rate of rejected clicks or conversions exceeds a predefined threshold. This helps you take immediate action to investigate and mitigate potential issues related to traffic quality or fraudulent activity.

## Steps to Set Up an Alert for High Rejection Rate

### Choose Alert Type

* Navigate to the Alerts tab and click +Create to begin the setup wizard. Alerts can be configured for Clicks or Conversions, but only one type can be set per alert.
* Alert Name: Assign a name to the alert and select the desired notification channel.
* Skip Resolved Notifications: Toggle off if you want to be notified when a resolved alert threshold re-triggers.
* Repeat Firing Notifications: Enable to send notifications each time the threshold is met during evaluations. Disable if alerts are too frequent.
* Activated: Use this setting to temporarily disable the alert without deleting it.

### Define Alert Conditions

* Target: Choose the specific integration to monitor (useful for accounts with multiple integrations).
* Offer Filters: Add Offer IDs to include in the evaluation. Leave blank to evaluate all offers.
* Publisher Filters: Add Publisher IDs to include in the evaluation. Leave blank to evaluate all publishers.
