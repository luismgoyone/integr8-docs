## Introduction

The Advertiser creation is the first step to take before setting up any new offer and start an ad campagin tracking. [Offers](https://integr8.co/docs/offer-setup/ "Offer creation guide") are always related to an Advertiser that has to be created upfront.

### Hint

Optionally you can create various Advertisers for your offers or only one in case all offers should be related to your account only. You may also use "Advertisers" as a grouping "category" for your offers. Later on, this groupping can turn useful when you want to apply specific rules, targeting or anti-fraud filters on "Advertiser" level so all offers grouped under a specific Advertiser will follow those rules.

NOTE: More advertisers can be created at any given moment and offers can be assigned to any of them at any time.
