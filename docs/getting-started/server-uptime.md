## Integr8 Tracking Platform Server Uptime & Low Latency Network

At Integr8, server stability and low latency are non-negotiable. Our infrastructure is built to support high-volume, real-time affiliate tracking with rock-solid uptime and ultra-fast response times, no matter where your traffic originates.

## Global Server Locations

By strategically placing our data centers close to major traffic sources, we reduce round-trip latency and ensure faster click and conversion processing. Integr8 operates a distributed server infrastructure across key global regions, including:

* Europe (EU)
* North America
* Asia

## Automatic Region Failover

To guard against data center outages, our platform supports Automatic Region Failover. If one region becomes unreachable due to a network or hardware failure, traffic is instantly rerouted to the next available region with zero manual intervention. This ensures your tracking remains live and uninterrupted.

## 24/7 Uptime Monitoring

We perform continuous uptime checks across all regions using independent monitoring systems. Our systems run health checks every 30 seconds, ensuring instant detection and response to any performance degradation or downtime.

### Multi-Layer Security & Downtime Prevention

These systems are not just for security, they also play a key role in maintaining platform availability and performance under load or attack. Our platform is protected with multiple security layers that go beyond firewalls:

* DDoS protection
* WAF (Web Application Firewall)
* Rate limiting and abuse detection
* Geo-fencing and bot filtering

## Ultra-Low Latency Network

Integr8 leverages cloud-native architecture, optimized for speed and horizontal scalability. Our infrastructure is built for high-throughput performance under heavy concurrent loads without sacrificing response time.

### Our globally distributed CDN-like network ensures:

* Sub-20ms click tracking times in most regions
* Minimal propagation delay
* Near-instant conversion fire events

With global server coverage, real-time failover, 24/7 monitoring, and a low-latency cloud-native network, Integr8 Tracking Platform delivers the speed, stability, and reliability your business depends on, no excuses.
