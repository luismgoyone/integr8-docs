## Onboarding & Continuous Support

At Integr8, we offer responsive, multi-level support designed to help you succeed. Our onboarding and enterprise clients benefit from dedicated Slack support for direct communication. A 24/7 AI chatbot, trained on our knowledge base, is available to handle most questions instantly—escalating urgent matters to our team even outside business hours or on weekends. Backed by a dynamic, international team, we genuinely care about your success and work closely with you to achieve your goals.

You can also test our AI ChatBot - Jessica. She is always helpful and is trained on our internal knowledge base.
