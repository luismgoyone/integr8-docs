## Introduction

A postback URL is a specific type of URL used to send data from one server to another after a particular event occurs, often used in affiliate marketing. When a user completes a specified action (such as a purchase, form submission, or signup), the different postback types can be triggered to notify the affiliate or tracking platform that the conversion happened.

The postback URL typically includes parameters that carry dynamic data, such as the transaction ID, user ID, or sale amount, to ensure proper tracking of conversions or events. It's crucial in tracking systems to verify and record successful conversions.

## Selecting affiliate postback types
