## ISP Filter: Blocking Fraudulent Traffic by ISP

The ISP Filter is a fraud prevention tool that blocks traffic from specific Internet Service Providers (ISPs) known for generating fraudulent activities. TIt is a critical fraud prevention tool designed to block traffic from providers known for generating fraudulent or low-quality traffic.

By maintaining a blacklist of such ISPs, the filter prevents invalid clicks and protects ad campaigns from being undermined by fraudsters. This filter works by adding the ISP's name to a blacklist, which then blocks any clicks originating from these sources.

## How It Works

*Blacklist-Based Blocking*: The filter maintains a list of ISPs associated with fraudulent activities. Any traffic originating from these blacklisted ISPs is automatically blocked.

*Customizable ISP Selection*: Users can select from a comprehensive list of ISPs to add to their blacklist, tailoring the filter to their specific needs.

*Real-Time Protection*: The filter operates in real-time, ensuring that fraudulent traffic is blocked immediately, thereby safeguarding ad campaigns from potential fraud.

## Setup Instructions

Navigate to *Offers -> Fraud Detection Group -> Select a filter group* to edit:

* **Access the ISP Filter Settings**: Navigate to the ISP Filter section in your filter group.
* **Select ISPs to Block**: Browse through the list of available ISPs and select those you wish to block.
* **Add to Blacklist**: Add the selected ISPs to your blacklist to activate the filter.
* **Save** **Changes**: Ensure you save your settings to apply the changes.

## Best Practice

* Regularly Update Blacklist: Periodically review and update your blacklist to include new ISPs that may be associated with fraudulent activities.
* Monitor Traffic Reports: Keep an eye on your traffic reports to identify any unusual patterns that may indicate the need to update your ISP blacklist.
* Combine with Other Filters: Use the ISP Filter in conjunction with other fraud detection tools for comprehensive protection.
