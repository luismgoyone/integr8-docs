## Introduction

The Emulator and Bots filter is designed to detect and block non-human traffic sources that can skew your performance metrics and lead to fraudulent attributions. This includes traffic generated by emulators, headless browsers, click farms, data centers, and other automation tools.

## How It Works

We leverage a multi-point analysis to identify bot traffic. This includes but is not limited to:

* User Agent anomalies: Identifies spoofed or suspicious agents common to automation tools.
* IP frequency analysis: Flags IPs with unusually high request rates or unnatural access patterns.
* Device behavior profiling: Looks for characteristics inconsistent with real human interaction.

The goal is to ensure that only legitimate, human-initiated events make it into your reports.

## Why It Matters

As a marketer, you want to avoid:

* Click flooding: Bots triggering excessive clicks to exploit attribution models.
* False attribution: Fraudulent traffic being misattributed to real campaigns.
* Wasted ad spend: Paying for impressions or conversions that never involved a real user.

Enabling this filter helps preserve the integrity of your campaigns and the accuracy of your attribution data.

## Best Practices

* Always review flagged traffic to understand patterns.
* Use this filter in combination with other fraud detection layers.
* Keep it enabled by default unless you have a known use case for disabling.
