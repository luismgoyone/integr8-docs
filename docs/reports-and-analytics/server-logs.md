## Introduction

Useful for troubleshooting server errors and setup issues.

Server Logs is a reporting tool that will allow you to keep under control the results beyond the standard reporting. The Logs will record and display not only the results successfully recorded (conversions, events, etc) but also the requests that are received and get rejected or contain an error response.
