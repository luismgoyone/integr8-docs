Integr8 tracking platform offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to enhance affiliate marketing efficiency and effectiveness. Here's an overview of key features:

## Publisher Setup

Integr8 provides two methods for creating publisher profiles:


1. **Admin Addition**: Administrators can manually add publishers by navigating to the Publishers menu and selecting "*Add New Publisher*." This involves filling out general details, account information, and promotional specifics.
2. **Self-Signup**: With a custom Partner Login [white-label setup](https://integr8.co/docs/articles/affiliate-dashboard/ "How to create a Custom Affiliate Signup Dashboard"), publishers can self-register, streamlining the onboarding process.

## Custom Payouts

To accommodate diverse partnership agreements, Integr8 allows for custom payouts per publisher:

* Navigate to the Publishers overview page.
* Select a publisher and access the Custom Payouts tab.
* Create a new custom payout by specifying the event, payout type, and desired value.

This flexibility ensures that payout structures align with specific performance metrics and partnership terms.

## Blocked Sub-IDs

To maintain traffic quality, Integr8 enables the blocking of specific sub-IDs:

* Go to the Publishers overview page.
* Select a publisher and navigate to the Blocked Sub-IDs tab.
* Create a new block by selecting the offer and sub-ID, and optionally add a description for the blocking reason.

This feature helps in filtering out unwanted or low-quality traffic sources.

## Affiliate Dashboard

Integr8's customizable, white-label Affiliate Dashboard empowers affiliates to:

* View performance statistics.
* Explore and access available offers.
* Generate tracking links.
* Configure postbacks for their sub-affiliates.

Setting up this dashboard involves configuring domain settings, profile details, and ensuring proper DNS configurations to align with your brand identity.

By leveraging these features, businesses can optimize their affiliate marketing strategies, ensuring tailored partnerships, effective traffic management, and enhanced affiliate engagement.
