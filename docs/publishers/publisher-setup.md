## Introduction

There are two ways to manage the publisher setup in Integr8 platform:


1. By creating a publisher profile manually using your Admin account.
2. The publisher can signup and create its own account. This will require a ***[Partner Login White-Label](https://integr8.co/docs/affiliate-dashboard/ "Affiliate Dashboard")*** to be previously set.

## Manual Publisher Setup

* Go to ***Publishers*** menu and click on ***+Create***
* Fill in ***General*** publiosher details
* Click ***Continue*** for the next step

## Publisher Settings

* **Activated**: disabling a publisher will stop it from generating traffic
* **Enable Fraud Visibility**: if enabled, fraud detection stats will show in publisher'ìs dashboard as well
* **Enable Postback Management**: in enabled, the publisher can create and manage postbacks
* **Tags**: use tags to quickly find data related to a publisher
