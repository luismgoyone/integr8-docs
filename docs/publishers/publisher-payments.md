## Introduction

The publisher ***Publisher Payments Overview*** page in Integr8 displays the amounts to be paid to publishers based on the selected time frame.

The page shows a table with the following columns:

* Paypal Email, Tiplati ID or Wire Transfer reference contact
* Publisher
* Currency
* Payout
* VAT%
* Payout including Tax

The table can be filtered using the dropdown menus for:

* Payment method
* Time range
* Currency (USD and EURO)
* Publisher

The results can also be exported to CSV by clicking on the Export icon.

Each row in the table provides two options:

* *Edit Payout* — manually adjust the payout amount.
* *Exclude from report* — remove the payout from the export and reporting.

## How to edit Publisher Billing info:

For publishers to appear in this view, you must first configure their billing information properly.

* Navigate to ***Publisher*** > ***Publishers Management***.
* Select a **Publisher**.
* Go to the ***Settings TAB*** > ***[Billing](https://integr8.co/docs/articles/publisher-billing/)***[ section](https://integr8.co/docs/articles/publisher-billing/).

Set:

* Currency
* VAT Number
* VAT Percentage
* Payment Method — choose between Paypal, Tiplati, and Wire Transfer.

If these billing details are not set, the publisher will not show up correctly in the *Publisher Payments Overview*.
