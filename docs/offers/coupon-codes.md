## Introduction

Leverage the power of coupon codes and tracking links to maximize your brand's performance across platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram.

With Integr8's Coupon Code Tracking, you can easily empower influencers and affiliates, ensure accurate attribution, and prevent coupon abuse, all while simplifying the promotion and conversion journey.

## Why Use Coupon Codes?

**Simplify the Conversion Flow** Influencers love tools that are easy to use. Shareable coupon codes offer a frictionless experience for creators and followers, improving adoption and conversion rates on social platforms.

**One-Click Tracking Link Generator** Each coupon code comes bundled with a custom tracking URL, purpose-built for seamless integration into any platform, landing pages, social bios, or direct messaging.

**Prevent Coupon Poaching** Coupon misuse kills campaigns. Integr8 safeguards your program by ensuring every influencer is credited for their work, no more stolen attributions.

### From Tracking Links to Custom Coupons

Affiliate links often get stripped, mistracked, or overlooked, especially in social or mobile-first environments. Coupon codes are:

* Easy to share across platforms
* Tied to performance reports
* Harder to manipulate or poach

With Integr8, each code is:

* Uniquely assigned to a publisher
* Trackable with full analytics
* Protected by anti-poaching measures
* Bundled with a custom link for broader sharing

You also unlock the ability to identify under-the-radar performers, optimize churn, and lower influencer acquisition costs.
