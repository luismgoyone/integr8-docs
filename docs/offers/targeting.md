## Introduction

The Integr8 platform includes the possibility to create various offer targeting rules to be applied selectively on specific offers. The targeting options available are:

* Geo - by country and city
* Device - by type, OS and browser
* IP
* Language

## Set up

There are two ways to apply a targeting to an offer:

* Individually, from [offer settings](https://integr8.co/docs/articles/offer-setup/ "Offer Setup Guide")
* By creating a Targeting Group to be used with various offers sharing the same setting

## Offer Level Targeting

Define the offer level targeting by navigating to ***Offers*** overview page, select an offer then go to the ***Targeting TAB***. Select the offer targeting options to allow or reject for the selected offer and click ***Save***.

## Targeting Groups

Using offer Targeting Groups allows you a better control when more offers share the same targeting options. By creating a targeting group, you can apply it on various offers at the same time without the necessity to set up the same rule on each offer individually.

**How to create a targeting group**:

From the main Menu, navigate to ***Offers > Targeting***, then follow the next steps:


1. Click ***+Create*** to start adding a new group
2. **General Settings**: insert a Name and a Description for this group
3. **Assign Offers**: you can already assign the offers for this group OR you can leave it empty and assign the offers later
4. Click ***Next*** to continue tot he next steps where you can set up the targeting rules for Clicks and Conversions
5. Click ***Save*** at the end of the setup flow.

**How to assign a targeting group to an offer:**


1. Go to ***Offers > Targeting***, access the selected Targeting Group settings and add the offers to the group from the General Settings TAB (*described above*).
2. You may also assign a Targeting Group to an offer by accessing the **Offer** settings, then go to ***Targeting TAB*** and click ***Assign Targeting Group***. A pop-up window will open where you can select a previously created group from the dropdown menu.
