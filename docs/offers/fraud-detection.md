### 2.  Filters selection for fraud screening

In the following steps, it is possible to define the filters to be used individually for Click, Conversion and/or Impression screening. It is possible to activate the filters only for clicks or only for conversions; in this case, the data with no active filters will not be screened for fraud.

There are also Pre-Set filters as well that can be selected and the filter setup will be applied accordingly. The pre-sets are using the "best practice" setup  for different cases. Use these when the settings are matching your goal or as an example. Once a pre-set is selected, it can be customized as well before saving.
